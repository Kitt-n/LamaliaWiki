## How to use?
Use water or a water cauldron to convert concrete powder into concrete blocks without the need to place and break them. Simply drop <font color="Red">(Ctrl+Q to drop entire stack(x64) at once)</font> the powder into <font color="#5971f7">water</font> or the <font color="#5971f7">water cauldron</font>, wait a few seconds, and instantly receive a concrete block.

If you use a water cauldron, the water level will decrease by 1.
