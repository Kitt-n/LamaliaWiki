# Dispenser Ability
A dispenser use certain items or tools or place certain blocks, fluids and solid or entities when given a redstone signal.
In this feature, the following capabilities are all about dispenser capabilities and how to use them in the server.

## Dispenser Place Block

The block faces in the same direction as the Dispenser. Its operation requires a redstone signal that is not too fast. If the signal speed is too high, the Dispenser will shoot the item instead of placing the block.
and case If a block already occupies the target position, the Dispenser will shoot the item instead of placing it.

## Dispenser Break Block

Blocks can be broken, and items are dropped. Items to be broken must be attached to the dispenser. Inside, there must be a tool capable of breaking the blocks. The operation requires a redstone signal. Once activated, the dispenser cannot be stopped until the block is destroyed.
