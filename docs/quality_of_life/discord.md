## Linking Process

Follow these steps to link your Discord account:

1. **Generate a Link Code**

   Use the following command in-game:
   ```
   /discord link
   ```

   You will receive a code. It should look something like this:

   

2. **Submit the Code to the Bot**

   :::tip
   Search for the bot named **Lamalia** on Discord.
   :::

   Send a Direct Message (DM) to the Lamalia bot with the code you received.

3. **Confirmation**

   If successful, the bot will reply with a message similar to:

   ```
   "Your Discord account has been linked to Username (Your UUID)"
   ```

   This message confirms that your account is now linked.

## Verifying Your Link Status

You can check if your Discord account is linked at any time:

1. Use the following command in-game:
   ```
   /discord linked
   ```

2. The system will inform you of your link status:

   **If linked:**

   

   **If not linked:**

   

:::caution
Make sure to keep your link code private. Anyone with access to this code could potentially link their Discord account to your game account.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the linking process:

1. Ensure you're using the correct bot (Lamalia).
2. Double-check that you've entered the link code correctly.
3. Try generating a new link code if the old one doesn't work.
4. If problems persist, contact a server administrator for assistance.
