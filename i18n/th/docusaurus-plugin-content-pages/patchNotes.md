**Fixes**

**Notes**
Why do We need to make some area protected? such as Old Spawn and End Island?
- Old Spawn is a piece of server history, and we want to preserve it for future players to see. 
- End Island is a central location for the server, and we want to keep it accessible for all players to use and appreciate. not filled with machines and farms for personal gain.
- Also End Island portal is connected with old spawn. so farming and machine will harm old spawn indirectly.
- So, what will happen with machines, farms and land in the end island?
  - We will remove them gradually and give a warning to the owner. if the owner does not remove them, we will remove them for you.
  - We will not remove any builds, only machines and farms.
